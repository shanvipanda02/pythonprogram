What is a programming language ?

Programming language is used to process the data or instruction 

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Here are some key features and uses

An interpreter is a program that executes code line-by-line, translating it directly into machine instructions at runtime.

A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code of a programming language into machine code before execution.
What is a token ?
In programming languages, a token is the smallest unit of meaningful data that the compiler or interpreter can process. 
Types of Tokens
Keywords: Reserved words that have a specific meaning in the language syntax.
Examples: if, while, return, class in languages like C++, Java, and Python.
Identifiers: Names given to various program elements such as variables, functions, arrays, etc.
Examples: myVariable, calculateSum, Student.
Operators: Symbols that represent operations to be performed.
Examples: +, -, *, /, =, ==.
Literals: Fixed values in the code.
Examples: 42 (integer literal), 3.14 (floating-point literal), 'c' (character literal), "Hello, World!" (string literal).
Separators (or Delimiters): Characters that separate tokens from each other.
Examples: , (comma), ; (semicolon), { (left brace), } (right brace), ( (left parenthesis), ) (right parenthesis).
Comments: Annotations in the code that are ignored by the compiler.
Examples: // This is a single-line comment (in C++, Java), /* This is a multi-line comment */
What is python instruction ?
A Python instruction is a single line of code that performs a specific action or operation in a Python program.
